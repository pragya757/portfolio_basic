            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am a frontend developer with a robust foundation in creating responsive, user-centered web applications. My expertise spans HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks, allowing me to bring interactive and visually appealing interfaces to life. Alongside my frontend skills, I have minimal knowledge in object-oriented programming with C++, which enhances my ability to design well-structured and maintainable code.</p>

            <h3>Parking Space Counter</h3>
            <p>The Parking Space Counter is a Python project designed to manage parking occupancy in real-time, ideal for facilities like malls and offices. It leverages data structures such as arrays and queues to track parking spaces, with stacks for priority parking. Divided into sections (general, reserved, EV), the system dynamically updates availability, reducing wait times by quickly allocating spots. Optional IoT integration can automate occupancy detection, enhancing functionality. Key features include real-time updates and efficient algorithms for space allocation, counting, and searching, making the project a practical application of Python and data structure concepts for optimized parking management.</p>
